(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying
Things that you can't say tomorrow day
 
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you
